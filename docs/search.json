    "section": "Problem 2: Loading and Cleaning Data",
    "text": "Problem 2: Loading and Cleaning Data\nFor this problem, rather than creating our own dataset from scratch, we will load and analyze a pre-existing dataset on global superstore orders.\n\nQuestion 2.1\n\nFirst, import the file named Global_Superstore_Orders_2016.csv using R’s built-in read.csv() function, storing the result into a data.frame variable named orders.\nNext, read more about the read.csv() function by typing ??read.csv in the R Console. Make sure you understand the optional header argument, since you’ll need to provide the TRUE as the value for this argument when you call the read.csv() function in the previous step!\nFinally, display the first six rows of orders as the output of your code cell, by using R’s built-in head() function.\n\n\n\nQuestion 2.2\nUse str() to check the type of each variable. You’ll see that read.csv() did not correctly identify the data types for all columns loaded from the .csv file. Which variables have inappropriate types, and what should their data types be instead?\n\n\nQuestion 2.3\nCreate a separate data.frame named sales_data, containing only the following columns from orders: Order.Date, Ship.Date, State, Country, Sales, Profit, and Order.Priority. Display the first six rows of sales_data (using head()) as the output of your code cell.\n\n\nQuestion 2.4\nUpdate the sales_data data.frame you created in Q2.3 so that the columns you identified in Q2.2 have the correct types (factor, Date,..etc.).\nHint: You’ll want to use the lubridate library to convert character strings into Date types. To do so, you’ll need to identify what format the dates are in, then use the appropriate function from the Parse Date-Times section of the lubridate cheat sheet. The following cell provides an example, where we parse the character string \"2024-05-01\" into a Date object representing the 31st day of December in the year 2024:\n\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'lubridate'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    date, intersect, setdiff, union\n\nexample_date_str &lt;- \"2024-12-31\"\nparsed_date &lt;- ymd(example_date_str)\nparsed_date\n\n[1] \"2024-12-31\"\n\nclass(parsed_date)\n\n[1] \"Date\"\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2.5\nUse str() on the updated sales_data variable to confirm that each of the variables you identified in Q2.2 now has the correct type.\n\n\nQuestion 2.6\nCheck whether there are any NA/missing values in sales_data.\n\n\nQuestion 2.7\nStore the names of the columns of sales_data into a new variable called sales_col_names. Also find out how many rows that the dataset has and assign it to the variable sales_num_rows. Display the values of both sales_col_names and sales_num_rows as the output of your code cell. (We may use this dataset and these variables in future assignments)\n\n\nQuestion 2.8\nQ2.8: Write code to compute the mean value of the Sales column when the order priority is \"Critical\", and the mean value of Sales when the order priority is \"High\". Which of the two mean values is greater?\n\n\nQuestion 2.9 (Bonus)\n(For +1 bonus point) Compute the mean sales for each of the 50 US states.\nHint: you should use R’s built-in aggregate() function to accomplish this, rather than manually entering the names of all 50 states!"
