## Part 1: Generating a Deck of Cards

### Question 1.1

Create a vector for card **suits** with the variable name `suits`, containing the following four elements (as character strings): `"Diamonds"`, `"Clubs"`, `"Hearts"`, `"Spades"`. Write `suits` (on its own) as the final line of your code cell, so that the output of the cell shows the contents of the vector you created.

### Question 1.2

Create a vector for card **numbers** with the variable name `numbers`, containing the character string `"Ace"` followed by the integers 2 through 10. Display the contents of `numbers` as the output of your code cell (as you did in Q1.1).

### Question 1.3

Create a vector for **face cards** with the variable name `faces`, containing the character strings `"Jack"`, `"Queen"`, and `"King"`. Display the contents of `faces` as the output of your code cell.

### Question 1.4

Create a new vector with the variable name `card_names`, formed by concatenating the elements of the `faces` vector to the end of the `numbers` vector. Display the contents of `card_names` as the output of your code cell.

### Question 1.5

Repeat each element in `card_names` four times, and name the new variable `card_names_4`. Display the contents of `card_names_4` as the output of your code cell.

### Question 1.6

Repeat each element in `suits` 13 times, naming the new variable `suits_13`. Display the contents of `suits_13` as the output of your code cell.

### Question 1.7

Create a `data.frame` variable named `card_deck`, constructed so that its first column is named `card_name` and contains the values of `card_names_4`, and its second column is named `suit` and contains the values of `suits_13`. Display the contents of `card_deck` as the output of your code cell.

### Question 1.8

Create a new column in `card_deck` named `card` by **pasting** the values in the first column (`card_name`) to the values in the second column (`suit`). Here you can use the built-in R function `paste()` to paste these 2 variables together. Display the *new* contents of `card_deck` as the output of your code cell.

### Question 1.9

Now you have a deck of cards, which you can use to compute probabilities! First, to verify that the deck was successfully created, write code which outputs the **number of rows** in the `card_deck` `data.frame` (it should be 52, if the above steps were carried out correctly)

### Question 1.10

Now, use what you know about **filtering** the values in a `data.frame` to compute the probability that a randomly-drawn card from `card_deck` is a Spade, and display this probability as the output of your code cell.

### Question 1.11

Use `card_deck` again to compute the probability that, when drawing *two* cards from the deck, the first is a Spade and the second is a Heart. Display this probability as the output of your code cell.

### Question 1.12

Now let's simulate playing poker! Using what you know about sampling from a `data.frame`, sample 5 cards from `card_deck` (please use `set.seed(2024)` to set the random seed to be 2024, so that results are the same across different submissions). Display the sampled 5-card hand as the output of your code cell. Then, using the following image as a guide if you're unfamiliar with poker, comment on the cards you obtained---did your random draw result in one of the types of hands displayed in the image?

## Problem 2: Loading and Cleaning Data

For this problem, rather than creating our own dataset from scratch, we will load and analyze a pre-existing dataset on _global superstore orders_.

### Question 2.1

* First, import the file named `Global_Superstore_Orders_2016.csv` using R's built-in `read.csv()` function, storing the result into a `data.frame` variable named `orders`.
* Next, read more about the `read.csv()` function by typing `??read.csv` in the R Console. Make sure you understand the optional `header` argument, since you'll need to provide the `TRUE` as the value for this argument when you call the `read.csv()` function in the previous step!
* Finally, display the first six rows of `orders` as the output of your code cell, by using R's built-in `head()` function.

### Question 2.2

Use `str()` to check the type of each variable. You'll see that `read.csv()` did not correctly identify the data types for all columns loaded from the `.csv` file. Which variables have inappropriate types, and what should their data types be instead?

### Question 2.3

Create a separate `data.frame` named `sales_data`, containing only the following columns from `orders`: `Order.Date`, `Ship.Date`, `State`, `Country`, `Sales`, `Profit`, and `Order.Priority`. Display the first six rows of `sales_data` (using `head()`) as the output of your code cell.

### Question 2.4

Update the `sales_data` `data.frame` you created in Q2.3 so that the columns you identified in Q2.2 have the correct types (`factor`, `Date`,..etc.).

*Hint*: You'll want to use the `lubridate` library to convert `character` strings into `Date` types. To do so, you'll need to identify what *format* the dates are in, then use the appropriate function from the **Parse Date-Times** section of the [`lubridate` cheat sheet](https://rawgit.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/lubridate.pdf){target='_blank'}. The following cell provides an example, where we parse the `character` string `"2024-05-01"` into a `Date` object representing the 31st day of December in the year 2024:

```{r}
library(lubridate)
example_date_str <- "2024-12-31"
parsed_date <- ymd(example_date_str)
parsed_date
class(parsed_date)
```

### Question 2.5

Use `str()` on the updated `sales_data` variable to confirm that each of the variables you identified in Q2.2 now has the correct type.

### Question 2.6

Check whether there are any `NA`/missing values in `sales_data`.

### Question 2.7

Store the names of the columns of `sales_data` into a new variable called `sales_col_names`. Also find out how many rows that the dataset has and assign it to the variable `sales_num_rows`. Display the values of both `sales_col_names` and `sales_num_rows` as the output of your code cell. (We may use this dataset and these variables in future assignments)

### Question 2.8

**Q2.8**: Write code to compute the mean value of the `Sales` column when the order priority is `"Critical"`, and the mean value of `Sales` when the order priority is `"High"`. Which of the two mean values is greater?

### Question 2.9 (Bonus)

(For +1 bonus point) Compute the mean sales for each of the 50 US states.

*Hint: you should use R's built-in `aggregate()` function to accomplish this, rather than manually entering the names of all 50 states!*
