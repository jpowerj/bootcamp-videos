## Problem 1: `ggplot`

1. Produce 5 different types of data visualizations using ggplot, plotly and ggplotly.

* Produce the ggplotly plot using stock prices. Please produce a graph that is meaningful in comparing certain stock prices as I have done in the lecture. I was comparing the stock prices of the Big Tech Companies. Please try to choose different stocks than what I have used in the lecture note.

To find the ticker of the stock to be used in `getSymbols()` in `quantmod` package; you can google the company stock and it will show you the ticker for that particular stock.

```{r}
# place your ggplotly visualization here
```

For the rest of the plots, Use the _**Sales.data dataset**_ that you created in Assignment 6 - problem 2 to provide more meaningful plots. Most of the plots should be of a different kind (bar,line,scatter,..etc). That means don't provide all of them as line graphs. :)

```{r}
# place visualization #2 here
```

```{r}
# place visualization #3 here
```

```{r}
# place visualization #4 here
```

```{r}
# place visualization #5 here
```

## Problem 2: Wordclouds

a. Produce a wordcloud using the Harry Potter Corpus ("HP_Corpus"). Write one or two sentences explaining what you observe by this WordCloud.

```{r}
# insert code here
```

> Insert observations here

b. Using the Harry Potter Corpus, which are the top five most used words in the corpus after stop words were removed? 

> Insert words here

c. Whose name appears more frequently in the Harry Potter Corpus, Ron's or Hermione's?  

> Insert name here

## Problem 3: APIs

Watch this video on Mixtape Medley with Ariana Grande and Kelly Clarkson in Jimmy Fallon's Show.
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF_EF8Rj9gs>

Use Spotify's API to do a comparison between Ariana Grande's and Kelly Clarkson's music using several data visualization.

```{r}
# insert code here
```

Please provide a description of your observations from the aforementioned video and your data visualization.
